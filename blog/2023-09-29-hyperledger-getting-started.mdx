# Hyperledger Fabric Getting Started

Hyperledger Fabric is a private, permissioned, and enterprise blockchain framework.
It has a modular architecture which helps in maximizing the confidentiality,
resilience, and flexibility of blockchain solutions. It creates separate
chains (ledgers) within the Fabric network using channels.

## Membership Service Provider (MSP)

- MSP is needed to access fabric network.

## Flow

Execute -> Order(Sequencing) -> Validate & commit

## How Hyperledger Works?
- The organizations that take part in building the Hyperledger Fabric network are called members.
- Each member organization in the network is responsible for setting up their peers to be a part of the network.
- These peers need to be configured with appropriate cryptographic materials (using MSP).
- Peers in an organization receive transaction invocation requests from the client inside the organization (connected by SDK).
- Chaincode installed in peers initiates transaction invocation requests.
- All the peers maintain their own ledger per channel.

## Note
- P2P Communication protocol (gRPC)
