## Problem Statement

Implement a first in first out (FIFO) queue using only two stacks.
The implemented queue should support all the functions of a normal
queue (`push`, `peek`, `pop`, and `empty`).

Implement the `MyQueue` class:

`void push(int x)` Pushes element x to the back of the queue.
`int pop()` Removes the element from the front of the queue and returns it.
`int peek()` Returns the element at the front of the queue.
`boolean empty()` Returns `true` if the queue is empty, `false` otherwise.

**Notes:**

- You must use only standard operations of a stack, which means only `push to top`,
`peek/pop from top`, `size`, and `is empty` operations are valid.
- Depending on your language, the stack may not be supported natively. You may
simulate a stack using a list or deque (double-ended queue) as long as you use
only a stack's standard operations.

Example 1:
```text
Input:
["MyQueue", "push", "push", "peek", "pop", "empty"]
[[], [1], [2], [], [], []]
Output:
[null, null, null, 1, 1, false]

Explanation:
MyQueue myQueue = new MyQueue();
myQueue.push(1); // queue is: [1]
myQueue.push(2); // queue is: [1, 2] (leftmost is front of the queue)
myQueue.peek(); // return 1
myQueue.pop(); // return 1, queue is [2]
myQueue.empty(); // return false
```

Constraints:
- `1 <= x <= 9`
- At most `100` calls will be made to `push`, `pop`, `peek`, and `empty`.
- All the calls to `pop` and `peek` are valid.

**Follow-up:** Can you implement the queue such that each operation is [amortized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amortized_analysis)
`O(1)` time complexity? In other words, performing `n` operations will take
overall `O(n)` time even if one of those operations may take longer.
