They are immutable, self-executing, decentralized, and trustworthy. Smart contracts offer many advantages, including efficiency, transparency, trust, and security. They can be used in various industries, such as supply chain management, real estate, insurance, and voting.\\n\\n## Describe the Structure of Smart Contract.\\n\\nSmart contracts are self-executing computer programs that enforce the terms of an agreement between parties on a blockchain network. The structure of a smart contract is defined using Solidity, which is a contract-oriented programming language. Here are some key concepts that define the structure of a smart contract:\\n\\n1. Types: The contract type is a struct that organizes a set of related functions around a single purpose. Address types are Ethereum addresses that equate to 20 bytes, and are represented in hexadecimal form beginning with the prefix 0x. Other types include booleans, integers, fixed-point numbers, byte arrays, and literals.\\n\\n2. Data Storage: In Solidity, reference data values can be stored as storage, memory or calldata depending on the role of the data stored. Storage keeps the data permanently on the blockchain and is expensive, while memory values are stored only for the lifetime of the smart contract\'s execution and are inexpensive to use. Calldata is a special data location that contains the function arguments and is only available for external function call parameters.\\n\\n3. Function Modifiers: Functions exist to get/set information based on calls initiated by external transactions. Access modifiers include public, external, internal, and private. Other modifiers include view, pure, and payable.\\n\\n4. Special Functions and Variables: There are a number of global variables and functions that will be helpful to remember you have access to, such as block.number, block.timestamp, block.gaslimit, msg.sender, and msg.value. Special functions include receive and fallback.\\n\\n5. Events: Solidity events are emitted when a contract is executed and stored permanently on the blockchain but aren\'t accessible to be modified/read by smart contracts. They can be declared and emitted using the event keyword and can be accessed in a variety of different ways.\\n\\nOverall, the structure of a smart contract involves defining types, data storage, function modifiers, special functions/variables, and events using Solidity.\\n\\n## Elaborate how the smart contracts interact with application.\\n\\nSmart contracts are self-executing programs that operate on a blockchain, enabling developers to create decentralized applications (dApps). These contracts are written in programming languages such as Solidity, Vyper, and others, and they run on top of a blockchain network. \\n\\nSmart contracts can interact with applications in various ways. One way is through the use of an Application Programming Interface (API). The API provides a set of protocols and tools that enable the smart contract to communicate with the application. The smart contract can then use this communication to receive input from the application, process it, and return output to the application. \\n\\nAnother way that smart contracts can interact with applications is through the use of events. Smart contracts can emit events, which can be monitored by the application. For example, if a smart contract is used to facilitate a payment, it can emit an event when the payment is complete. The application can then respond to this event by updating its user interface or performing other actions.\\n\\nSmart contracts can also interact with applications through the use of external data feeds. For example, a smart contract may need to obtain data from an external source, such as the current price of a particular commodity. The smart contract can then use this data to make decisions and perform actions.\\n\\nIn summary, smart contracts can interact with applications through APIs, events, and external data feeds. These interactions enable developers to create decentralized applications that can operate autonomously and transparently, without the need for intermediaries.\\n\\n\\n## Classify the different smart contract design patterns.\\n\\nSmart contract design patterns are reusable, repeatable solutions in writing code that serve a wide range of purposes. These patterns can be classified into four main functions: security patterns, efficiency patterns, access control patterns, and contract management patterns. \\n\\n1. **Security patterns** are designed to maximize the level of security of a smart contract against any risk. They are used to ward off reentrancy attacks, overflow attacks, or the flawed behavior of the actual smart contracts. Examples of security design patterns include balance limit pattern, pull over push payments, secure ether transfer, fork check, termination, math pattern, time constraint, mutex pattern, auto deprecation design pattern, and withdrawal pattern.\\n\\n2. **Efficiency patterns** optimize the operation of a smart contract or reduce the costs associated with using one. Using these patterns can save time and money for operators and users. Examples of efficiency patterns include use libraries, incentive execution, tight variable packing, limit storage, challenge response, write values, pull payments, publisher-subscriber, avoid redundant operations, use libraries, short constant strings, fail early and fail loud, limit modifiers, minimize on-chain data, and low contract footprint.\\n\\n3. **Access control patterns** restrict who can access and execute certain functions of the smart contract. This way, you can manage permissions and authorizations for a given function, like giving only the admin the ability to do something. Examples of restricting access patterns include hash secret, access restriction, judge, embedded permission, dynamic binding, multi-authorization, ownership and role-based access control, and off-chain secret enabled dynamic authorization.\\n\\n4. **Contract management patterns** refer to how contract owners organize their smart contracts and how the contracts work together. This allows you to make sure your contracts work together smoothly. Examples of design patterns in the contract management pattern category include migration, data contract, contract decorator, inter-family communication, flyweight, contract registry, contract mediator, satellite, contract observer, and factory pattern.\\n\\n5. **A factory pattern** is a type of design pattern where one contract acts as the factory in charge of churning out other contracts. The products the pattern creates using Solidity code are called child contracts. Solidity smart contracts that use a factory pattern can benefit from increased efficiency as well as security. However, there are always exceptions with your unique code to keep in mind. The potential drawback of a factory pattern is that it can be more costly in gas depending on how you set up your code. \\n\\nIn conclusion, smart contract design patterns are essential in the development of smart contracts. They provide tried-and-true coding paradigms that have performed routine functions well in other programs, avoiding errors, reducing costs, saving time, and preventing unintended consequences from occurring because of a new coding approach for a routine function.\\n\\n\\n## List and explain any two use cases of smart contract.\\n\\nSmart contracts are an emerging technology that has the potential to revolutionize various industries. Two common use cases of smart contracts are **DeFi** and **NFTs**. DeFi platforms utilize smart contracts to provide financial services without the need for a middleman. Smart contracts enable sophisticated transactions such as lending, borrowing, and derivative transactions on DeFi platforms. NFTs are another popular use case of smart contracts. Smart contracts enable the creation of non-fungible tokens by allocating ownership and managing the transferability of NFTs. These contracts can also be modified to include additional features such as royalty payments and access rights to a platform or software.\\n\\nIn addition to these common use cases, smart contracts have various B2B use cases such as copyright management, data marketplaces, and financial data recording. Smart contracts can simplify and facilitate royalty payments and record the ownership and other aspects of digital copyright assets such as digital ID or fingerprints on the blockchain. Data marketplaces can enable buyers to purchase data streams through automated smart contracts. Organizations can use smart contracts for accurate, transparent data recording while improving speed and security. A smart contract enables uniform financial data-keeping across organizations which eliminates the need to exchange other documents such as invoice images. \\n\\nSmart contracts also have industry-specific use cases such as gaming, healthcare, logistics, and real estate. In gaming, smart contracts are used to enable players to do common transactions such as buying and selling items and game-specific actions such as waging wars for loot, breeding characters, and so on. In healthcare, smart contracts are used for clinical trials and insurance processes. Smart contracts can speed up the process of property ownership changes and enable properties to be rented and listed on the Ethereum blockchain. Real estate ownership can be tokenized and sold like a real estate investment trust, and smart contracts can be written for real estate transactions so they provide rental income or dividends to the holders.\\n\\n\\n# Unit 2\\n\\n## How Ethereum Blockchain Platform executes the transactions explain with diagram.\\n\\nThe Ethereum Blockchain Platform executes transactions through a process that involves cryptographically signed instructions from accounts. Transactions are initiated by an externally-owned account, which is an account managed by a human, not a contract. The transaction is broadcasted to the whole network, and any node can request for the transaction to be executed on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). After this happens, a validator executes the transaction and propagates the resulting state change to the rest of the network. Transactions require a fee and must be included in a validated block. \\n\\nA submitted transaction includes information such as the address of the sender, the receiving address, the identifier of the sender, a sequentially incrementing counter which indicates the transaction number from the account, the amount of ETH to transfer from sender to recipient, optional field to include arbitrary data, the maximum amount of gas units that can be consumed by the transaction, the maximum price of the consumed gas to be included as a tip to the validator, and the maximum fee per unit of gas willing to be paid for the transaction. \\n\\nGas is a reference to the computation required to process the transaction by a validator, and users have to pay a fee for this computation. The gasLimit and maxPriorityFeePerGas determine the maximum transaction fee paid to the validator. The vast majority of transactions access a contract from an externally-owned account, and most contracts are written in Solidity and interpret their data field in accordance with the application binary interface (ABI). \\n\\nThere are a few different types of transactions on Ethereum, including regular transactions, contract deployment transactions, and execution of a contract. Transactions cost gas to execute, and any gas not used in a transaction is refunded to the user account. Once the transaction has been submitted, a transaction hash is cryptographically generated, and the transaction is broadcasted to the network and added to a transaction pool consisting of all other pending network transactions. A validator must pick the transaction and include it in a block to verify the transaction and consider it \\"successful\\". \\n\\nEthereum originally had one format for transactions, but it has evolved to support multiple types of transactions to allow for new features such as access lists and EIP-1559 to be implemented without affecting legacy transaction formats. EIP-2718 is what allows for this behavior, and transactions are interpreted as TransactionType || TransactionPayload, where the fields are defined as TransactionType - a number between 0 and 0x7f, for a total of 128 possible transaction types, and TransactionPayload - an arbitrary byte array defined by the transaction type. \\n\\nDiagram showing a transaction cause state change: \\n\\n![Diagram showing a transaction cause state change](https://ethereum.org/static/570dedb843948d6bef5e21a6769d5c35/302a4/tx.png)\\n\\nDiagram showing how unused gas is refunded: \\n\\n![Diagram showing how unused gas is refunded](https://ethereum.org/static/c3638b26a1210d2c73a7ec2335c57351/302a4/gas-tx.png)\\n\\n## Compare Ethereum Blockchain with Bitcoin.\\n| Comparison Factor | Bitcoin | Ethereum |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n| Purpose | Alternative to traditional currencies, medium of exchange and store of value | Programmable blockchain for DeFi, smart contracts, and NFTs |\\n| Market Capitalization (as of Aug. 30, 2022) | $376.5 billion, accounting for about 39.6% of the total cryptocurrency market | $818.8 billion, accounting for 18.8% of the total cryptocurrency market |\\n| Consensus Algorithm | SHA-256 | LMDGhost |\\n| Block Time | Minutes | Seconds |\\n| Proof Protocol | Proof of Work (PoW) | Proof of Stake (PoS) |\\n| Cryptocurrency in Circulation (as of Aug. 30, 2022) | 19.1 BTC | 122.2 ETH |\\n| Similarities | Decentralized, traded on online exchanges, stored in cryptocurrency wallets, use blockchain technology |\\n\\n## List and elaborate different Ethereum Development Tools.\\n## What are Ethereum\'s Four Stages of Development?\\n## List and explain various languages used to build smart contracts?\\n## What are different Ethereum Wallets?

If there is no common subsequence, return `0`.\\n\\nA *subsequence* of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.\\n\\n- For example, `\\"ace\\"` is a subsequence of `\\"abcde\\"`.\\n\\nA *common subsequence* of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings. \\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nExample 1:\\n```text\\nInput: text1 = \\"abcde\\", text2 = \\"ace\\" \\nOutput: 3  \\nExplanation: The longest common subsequence is \\"ace\\" and its length is 3.\\n```\\n\\nExample 2:\\n```text\\nInput: text1 = \\"abc\\", text2 = \\"abc\\"\\nOutput: 3\\nExplanation: The longest common subsequence is \\"abc\\" and its length is 3.\\n```\\n\\nExample 3:\\n```text\\nInput: text1 = \\"abc\\", text2 = \\"def\\"\\nOutput: 0\\nExplanation: There is no such common subsequence, so the result is 0.\\n```\\n\\nConstraints:\\n- `1 <= text1.length, text2.length <= 1000`\\n- `text1` and `text2` consist of only lowercase English characters.\\n\\n## Explanation\\n\\nLet `i1` and `i2` be two pointer pointing at `current` index in string `s1` and `s2` respectively.\\n\\nlet `dp(i1, i2, s1, s2)` denotes the length of longest common subsequence in string `s1[i1...n1]` and `s2[i2...n2]`.\\n\\nIf _i1 == n1_, implies s1[i1....n1] is empty.\\n\\n**Base Case:** longest common subsequence of any string with empty string is 0.\\nTherefore is any of _i1 == n1_ or _i2 == n2_ return `0`.\\n\\nNow, for any `i1` and `i2` there are 2 possibilities.\\n\\n```mermaid\\ngraph TD;\\n    root[\\"(i1, i2)\\"];\\n    eq[\\"s1[i1] == s2[i2]\\"];\\n    nq[\\"s1[i1] != s2[i2]\\"];\\n\\n    root --\x3e eq -- Pick --\x3e Pick[\\"Consider Current Characters in Subsequence\\"] --Recursive Call--\x3e next[\\"(i1+1, i2+1)\\"];\\n    eq -- Skip --\x3e Skip[\\"Skip Current Characters either from s1 or s2\\"];\\n\\n    root --\x3e nq -- Skip --\x3e Skip;\\n\\n    Skip --Recursive Call--\x3e next_i1[\\"(i1+1, i2)\\"];\\n    Skip --Recursive Call--\x3e next_i2[\\"(i1, i2+1)\\"];\\n```\\n\\n## Solution\\n\\n<Tabs>\\n\\n<TabItem value=\\"cpp1\\" label=\\"C++ Recursive\\">\\n\\n```cpp title=\'CPP: Recursive Brute Force Solution [Time Limit Exceeded]\'\\nclass Solution {\\nprivate:\\n    int dp(int i1, int i2, string &s1, string &s2) {\\n        int n1 = s1.size();\\n        int n2 = s2.size();\\n\\n        // Base Case\\n        if(i1 == n1 || i2 == n2) return 0;\\n\\n        if(s1[i1] == s2[i2]) {\\n            return max({\\n                dp(i1+1, i2+1, s1, s2) + 1,\\n                dp(i1, i2+1, s1, s2),\\n                dp(i1+1, i2, s1, s2),\\n            });\\n        }\\n        else {\\n            return max({\\n                dp(i1, i2+1, s1, s2),\\n                dp(i1+1, i2, s1, s2),\\n            });\\n        }\\n    }\\npublic:\\n    int longestCommonSubsequence(string text1, string text2) {\\n        return dp(0, 0, text1, text2);\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n\\nm               |n                  | Time Complexity  | Space Complexity\\n----------------|-------------------|------------------|-----------------\\nsize of string 1|size of string 2   | O(max(m,n)\\\\*m\\\\*n)| O(max(m,n))\\n\\n</TabItem>\\n\\n<TabItem value=\\"cpp2\\" label=\\"C++ Recursive DP\\">\\n\\n```cpp title=\'CPP: Recursive + Memoization [Accepted]\'\\nclass Solution {\\nprivate:\\n    int dp(int i1, int i2, string &s1, string &s2, vector<vector<int>> &cache) {\\n        int n1 = s1.size();\\n        int n2 = s2.size();\\n\\n        // Base Case\\n        if(i1 == n1 || i2 == n2) return 0;\\n\\n        if(cache[i1][i2] != -1) return cache[i1][i2];\\n\\n        if(s1[i1] == s2[i2]) {\\n            return cache[i1][i2] = max({\\n                dp(i1+1, i2+1, s1, s2, cache) + 1,\\n                dp(i1, i2+1, s1, s2, cache),\\n                dp(i1+1, i2, s1, s2, cache),\\n            });\\n        }\\n        else {\\n            return cache[i1][i2] = max({\\n                dp(i1, i2+1, s1, s2, cache),\\n                dp(i1+1, i2, s1, s2, cache),\\n            });\\n        }\\n    }\\npublic:\\n    int longestCommonSubsequence(string text1, string text2) {\\n        vector<vector<int>> cache(text1.size(), vector<int>(text2.size(), -1));\\n        return dp(0, 0, text1, text2, cache);\\n    }\\n};\\n```\\n\\n\\nm               |n                  | Time Complexity  | Space Complexity\\n----------------|-------------------|------------------|-----------------\\nsize of string 1|size of string 2   | O(m*n)           | O(m*n)\\n\\n</TabItem>\\n\\n</Tabs>\\n\\n\\n## Related Problems\\n- [Longest Common Substring](https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/1273766/longest-common-substring)\\n- [1092.
