# Graph Introduction

Here are some important topics related to graphs that are commonly covered in technical interviews:

01. **Graph representation**: How to represent a graph in memory,
    including `adjacency matrix` and `adjacency list` representations.
02. **Traversal algorithms**: How to traverse a graph, including `Depth-First Search (DFS)` and `Breadth-First Search (BFS)`.
03. **Shortest path algorithms**: How to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph, including `Dijkstra's algorithm` and `A*`.
04. **Minimum spanning tree algorithms**: How to find a minimum spanning tree in a graph, including `Kruskal's algorithm` and `Prim's algorithm`.
05. **Topological sorting**: How to order the nodes in a directed acyclic graph (DAG) such that for every directed edge uv, vertex u comes before v in the ordering using [DFS](https://youtu.be/5lZ0iJMrUMk) or [Kahn's Algorithm](https://youtu.be/73sneFXuTEg).
06. **Disjoint Set Union (Union Find)**: Given an element, how to find the set that it belongs to and Given two sets, how to merge them into a single set.
07. **Strongly connected components**: How to find the strongly connected components in a directed graph, using `Tarjan's algorithm` and `Kosaraju's Algorithm`.
08. **Graph coloring**: How to color the nodes in a graph such that no two adjacent nodes have the same color, using the `Welsh-Powell algorithm` or the `DSATUR algorithm`.
09. **Maximum flow**: How to find the maximum flow in a flow network, using the `Ford-Fulkerson algorithm` or the `Edmonds-Karp algorithm`.
10. **Network flow**: How to model and solve network flow problems, including the `max-flow min-cut theorem` and the `Ford-Fulkerson algorithm`.
11. **Graph theory concepts**: Understanding of basic graph theory concepts, such as `degrees of a node`, `connectedness`, and `bipartiteness`.

It's also helpful to be familiar with various types of graphs, such as directed and undirected graphs, weighted and unweighted graphs, and tree and cycle graphs.
