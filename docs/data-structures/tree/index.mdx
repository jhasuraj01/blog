# Tree Introduction

Here are some important topics related to trees that are commonly covered in technical interviews:

01. **Tree representation**: How to represent a tree in memory, including array and linked list representations.
02. **Tree traversal**: How to traverse a tree, including `in-order`, `pre-order`, and `post-order` traversals.
03. **Binary search tree**: How to implement and maintain a binary search tree, including insertion, deletion, and search operations.
04. **Heap**: How to implement and maintain a heap, including insertion, deletion, and heapify operations.
05. **Red-black tree**: How to implement and maintain a red-black tree, including insertion, deletion, and search operations.
06. **Trie**: How to implement and maintain a trie, including insertion, deletion, and search operations.
07. **Huffman coding tree**: How to construct a Huffman coding tree for data compression.
08. **Segment tree**: How to implement and maintain a segment tree, including construction, query, and update operations.
09. **Fenwick tree** (Binary Indexed Tree): How to implement and maintain a Fenwick tree, including construction, query, and update operations.
10. **AVL tree**: How to implement and maintain an AVL tree, including insertion, deletion, and search operations.

### Standard Tree Problems
- height of a tree
- diameter of a tree
- size of a tree
- lowest common ancestor

It's also helpful to be familiar with various types of trees, such as binary trees, `n-ary` trees, and balanced and unbalanced trees.
