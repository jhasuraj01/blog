# Algorithms on String

Here is a list of some common string algorithms:

01. **String searching algorithms**: algorithms for finding a pattern in a string, such as `Rabin-Karp Algorithm (Rolling Hash)`, the `Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP)` algorithm and the `Boyer-Moore algorithm`.
02. **String matching algorithms**: algorithms for determining whether a string matches a given pattern, such as `regular expression` matching and `finite automata` based matching.
03. **String manipulation algorithms**: algorithms for manipulating strings, such as string *concatenation*, string *reversal*, and string `permutation` generation.
04. **String compression algorithms**: algorithms for compressing strings, such as `Huffman coding` and `run-length encoding`.
05. **String sorting algorithms**: algorithms for sorting strings, such as `radix sort` and `multi-key quicksort`.
06. **String parsing algorithms**: algorithms for extracting information from strings, such as regular expression parsing and parsing of structured data formats (e.g., CSV, JSON).
07. **String hashing algorithms**: algorithms for computing hash values for strings, such as the SHA-2 and SHA-3 algorithms.
08. **String transformation algorithms**: algorithms for transforming strings, such as case conversion, character encoding and decoding, and transliteration.
09. **String similarity algorithms**: algorithms for measuring the similarity between two strings, such as the `Levenshtein distance` and the `Jaccard coefficient`.
10. **String correction algorithms**: algorithms for correcting errors in strings, such as spelling correction and grammar correction.
