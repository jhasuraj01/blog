# Kadane's Algorithm

Kadane's algorithm is an algorithm for finding the maximum sum of a
contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional array of numbers. It is
a simple yet powerful algorithm that can be used to solve a variety
of problems, including finding the maximum subarray sum in an array
of integers, the maximum sum of a submatrix in a matrix of integers,
and the maximum sum of a subsegment in a sequence of integers.

## Steps
01. Initialize the maximum sum to the first element of the array.
02. Iterate through the array, starting from the second element.
03. At each iteration, calculate the maximum sum of the subarray ending
    at the current element. This can be done by comparing the current
    element to the sum of the current element and the maximum sum
    of the subarray ending at the previous element. The maximum of these
    two values is the maximum sum of the subarray ending at the current element.
04. Update the maximum sum to be the maximum of the current maximum sum
    and the maximum sum of the subarray ending at the current element.
05. Return the maximum sum.

## Example
Suppose we have the following array of integers:

`[-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4]`

We can find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray using Kadane's algorithm as follows:

01. Initialize the maximum sum to `-2`.
02. Iterate through the array, starting from the second element.
03. At each iteration, calculate the maximum sum of the subarray ending at the
    current element. For example, at the second iteration, we compare `1` to the sum
    of `1` and `-2` (the maximum sum of the subarray ending at the previous element),
    and take the maximum of these two values, which is `1`.
04. Update the maximum sum to be the maximum of the current maximum sum and the
    maximum sum of the subarray ending at the current element. For example, at
    the second iteration, we update the maximum sum to be the maximum of `-2`
    and `1`, which is `1`.
05. Repeat this process for each element in the array. The final maximum sum will
    be the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray within the array. In this case, the
    maximum sum is `6`, which is the sum of the subarray `[4, -1, 2, 1]`.

Kadane's algorithm has a time complexity of `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the array, making it an efficient solution for finding the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray.
