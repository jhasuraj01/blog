# Introduction to Algorithms

The word Algorithm means ”A set of finite rules or instructions to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations” Or ”A procedure for solving a mathematical problem in a finite number of steps that frequently involves recursive operations”.

## Types of Algorithms
1. Brute Force Algorithm
2. Recursive Algorithm
3. Backtracking Algorithm
4. Searching Algorithm
5. Sorting Algorithm
6. Hashing Algorithm
7. Divide and Conquer Algorithm
8. Greedy Algorithm
9. Dynamic Programming Algorithm
10. Randomized Algorithm

## Algorithm complexity
1. Space Complexity
2. Time Complexity
