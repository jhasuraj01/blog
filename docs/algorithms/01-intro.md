# Introduction to Algorithms

The word Algorithm means ”A set of finite rules or instructions to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations” Or ”A procedure for solving a mathematical problem in a finite number of steps that frequently involves recursive operations”.

There are many important algorithms that are commonly covered in technical interviews. Here is a list of some common algorithms that you might be expected to know:

01. **Sorting algorithms**: algorithms for sorting a list of items, such as `bubble sort`, `insertion sort`, `merge sort`, and `quick sort`.
02. **Search algorithms**: algorithms for searching a list of items, such as `linear search`, `binary search`, and `ternary search`.
03. **Graph algorithms**: algorithms for working with graphs, such as `Depth-First Search (DFS)`, `Breadth-First Search (BFS)`, and shortest path algorithms (e.g., `Dijkstra's algorithm` and `A*`).
04. **Tree algorithms**: algorithms for working with trees, such as tree traversal algorithms and algorithms for maintaining binary search trees.
05. **Dynamic programming**: algorithms for solving problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems and storing the results to avoid unnecessary recomputation.
06. **Divide and conquer**: algorithms for solving problems by dividing them into smaller subproblems and solving each subproblem separately.
07. **Greedy algorithms**: algorithms for making locally optimal choices at each step in order to try to achieve a global optimal solution.
08. **String matching algorithms**: algorithms for finding patterns in strings, such as the `Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP)` algorithm and the `Boyer-Moore algorithm`.
09. **Hashing algorithms**: algorithms for mapping keys to indices in a hash table, such as `linear probing` and `separate chaining`.
10. **NP-hard problems**: understanding of the concept of NP-hard problems and techniques for solving them, such as `approximation algorithms` and `heuristics`.

It's also helpful to be familiar with various data structures, such as `arrays`, `linked lists`, `stacks`, `queues`, and `heaps`, and how to use them to implement algorithms efficiently.
